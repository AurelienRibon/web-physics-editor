# Web Physics Editor

That's a current work-in-progress aiming at rebuilding the complete **Physics Body Editor** engine to an HTML5 verison.

Currently, the server uses **Node.js** as its runtime, but the application is actually fully client-side, thanks to AngularJS and all these awesome javascript libraries.

## Configuration

- Install node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
- Open a command prompt in the project directory
- Run **npm install**
- Run **node server**
- Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4000
